This MERN stack hotel booking website offers users the ability to search for hotels based on their destination, check-in, and check-out dates. After searching, users can view a list of hotels, each with a "See Visibility" button for more details.
Clicking this button leads users to a page displaying comprehensive information about the selected hotel, including room types, amenities, photos, and reviews. Users can then proceed to book a room by selecting their preferences and making a payment.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
